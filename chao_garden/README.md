# Tiny Chao Garden

This package contains the dissasembled source code to the Tiny Chao Garden multiboot program
`mb_chao_garden.gba`:

```
sha1: 7bcd6a07af7c894746fa28073fe0c0e34408022d
```

It's likely this program is the same for all other games
in the advance trilogy, but it will be decompiled here for now.

This program is compiled, compressed, and packed into the `sa2` ROM as part of the `sa2` build process
