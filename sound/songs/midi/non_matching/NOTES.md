* song0020: line 5627 (of compiled) doesn't reuse the previous pattern even though it's identical. Need to understand how mid2agb detects these
* song0046: line 429 (of compiled) has a weird time signature change (28:012)
* song0291: needs something to change at tick 24?
* song0044: some time signature shift and maybe multiple time signatures
* song0042: time should start at 96, first track fits 4/6, other don't after some point
